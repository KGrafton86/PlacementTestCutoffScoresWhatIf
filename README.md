# PlacementTestCutoffScoresWhatIf
<p>Used Wolfram Languageâ€™s manipulate function and a 5-year cohort of student developmental placement data to create a what-if model to explore how changes in placement test cutoff scores would be likely to affect student success in core courses. Part of a larger project to evaluate whether the current placement testing system was beneficial to students. Presented my work at two conferences to diverse audiences: </p>
<ul><i>2018 Illinois Association of Institutional Research Forum</i>: audience had knowledge of higher education context, but limited knowledge of Wolfram Language.</ul>
<ul><i>2019 Wolfram Technology Conference</i>: audience had knowledge of Wolfram Language but most had limited knowledge of the higher education context. </ul>
